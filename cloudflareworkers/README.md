# Cloudflare workers Example

## How to Run

First ensure that your Wrangler version is up to date.

```bash
$ wrangler -v
```

Now, if you run `wrangler dev` within this directory, it should use the config
in `wrangler.toml` to run the example.

You can also run `wrangler deploy` to deploy the example.
